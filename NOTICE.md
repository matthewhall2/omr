## Eclipse Foundation Software User Agreement

November 22, 2017

### Usage Of Content
THE ECLIPSE FOUNDATION MAKES AVAILABLE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION,
INFORMATION AND/OR OTHER MATERIALS FOR OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS
(COLLECTIVELY "CONTENT"). USE OF THE CONTENT IS GOVERNED BY THE TERMS
AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF
LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW. BY USING
THE CONTENT, YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE CONTENT IS GOVERNED BY
THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE
LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW. IF YOU DO
NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS
AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES
INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE THE CONTENT.

### Applicable Licenses
Unless otherwise indicated, all Content made available by the Eclipse
Foundation is provided to you under the terms and conditions of the
Eclipse Public License Version 2.0 ("EPL"). A copy of the EPL is
provided with this Content and is also available at
http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0. For purposes of the EPL,
"Program" will mean the Content.

Content includes, but is not limited to, source code, object code,
documentation and other files maintained in the Eclipse Foundation
source code repository ("Repository") in software modules ("Modules")
and made available as downloadable archives ("Downloads").

* Content may be structured and packaged into modules to facilitate
  delivering, extending, and upgrading the Content. Typical modules
  may include plug-ins ("Plug-ins"), plug-in fragments ("Fragments"),
  and features ("Features").
* Each Plug-in or Fragment may be packaged as a sub-directory or JAR
  (Javaâ„¢ ARchive) in a directory named "plugins".
* A Feature is a bundle of one or more Plug-ins and/or Fragments and
  associated material. Each Feature may be packaged as a sub-directory
  in a directory named "features". Within a Feature, files named
  "feature.xml" may contain a list of the names and version numbers of
  the Plug-ins and/or Fragments associated with that Feature.
* Features may also include other Features ("Included
  Features"). Within a Feature, files named "feature.xml" may contain
  a list of the names and version numbers of Included Features.

The terms and conditions governing Plug-ins and Fragments should be
contained in files named "about.html" ("Abouts"). The terms and
conditions governing Features and Included Features should be
contained in files named "license.html" ("Feature Licenses"). Abouts
and Feature Licenses may be located in any directory of a Download or
Module including, but not limited to the following locations:

* The top-level (root) directory
* Plug-in and Fragment directories
* Inside Plug-ins and Fragments packaged as JARs
* Sub-directories of the directory named "src" of certain Plug-ins
* Feature directories

Note: if a Feature made available by the Eclipse Foundation is
installed using the Provisioning Technology (as defined below), you
must agree to a license ("Feature Update License") during the
installation process. If the Feature contains Included Features, the
Feature Update License should either provide you with the terms and
conditions governing the Included Features or inform you where you can
locate them. Feature Update Licenses may be found in the "license"
property of files named "feature.properties" found within a
Feature. Such Abouts, Feature Licenses, and Feature Update Licenses
contain the terms and conditions (or references to such terms and
conditions) that govern your use of the associated Content in that
directory.

THE ABOUTS, FEATURE LICENSES, AND FEATURE UPDATE LICENSES MAY REFER TO
THE EPL OR OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS, NOTICES OR TERMS AND
CONDITIONS. SOME OF THESE OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS MAY INCLUDE (BUT
ARE NOT LIMITED TO):

* Eclipse Public License Version 1.0 (available at http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html)
* Eclipse Distribution License Version 1.0 (available at http://www.eclipse.org/licenses/edl-v1.0.html)
* Common Public License Version 1.0 (available at http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl-v10.html)
* Apache Software License 1.1 (available at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE)
* Apache Software License 2.0 (available at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
* Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 (available at http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html)

IT IS YOUR OBLIGATION TO READ AND ACCEPT ALL SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS
PRIOR TO USE OF THE CONTENT. If no About, Feature License, or Feature
Update License is provided, please contact the Eclipse Foundation to
determine what terms and conditions govern that particular Content.

### Use of Provisioning Technology
The Eclipse Foundation makes available provisioning software, examples
of which include, but are not limited to, p2 and the Eclipse Update
Manager ("Provisioning Technology") for the purpose of allowing users
to install software, documentation, information and/or other materials
(collectively "Installable Software"). This capability is provided
with the intent of allowing such users to install, extend and update
Eclipse-based products. Information about packaging Installable
Software is available at
http://eclipse.org/equinox/p2/repository_packaging.html
("Specification").

You may use Provisioning Technology to allow other parties to install
Installable Software. You shall be responsible for enabling the
applicable license agreements relating to the Installable Software to
be presented to, and accepted by, the users of the Provisioning
Technology in accordance with the Specification. By using Provisioning
Technology in such a manner and making it available in accordance with
the Specification, you further acknowledge your agreement to, and the
acquisition of all necessary rights to permit the following:

1. A series of actions may occur ("Provisioning Process") in which a
   user may execute the Provisioning Technology on a machine ("Target
   Machine") with the intent of installing, extending or updating the
   functionality of an Eclipse-based product.
2. During the Provisioning Process, the Provisioning Technology may
   cause third party Installable Software or a portion thereof to be
   accessed and copied to the Target Machine.
3. Pursuant to the Specification, you will provide to the user the
   terms and conditions that govern the use of the Installable
   Software ("Installable Software Agreement") and such Installable
   Software Agreement shall be accessed from the Target Machine in
   accordance with the Specification. Such Installable Software
   Agreement must inform the user of the terms and conditions that
   govern the Installable Software and must solicit acceptance by the
   end user in the manner prescribed in such Installable Software
   Agreement. Upon such indication of agreement by the user, the
   provisioning Technology will complete installation of the
   Installable Software.

### Cryptography
Content may contain encryption software. The country in which you are
currently may have restrictions on the import, possession, and use,
and/or re-export to another country, of encryption software. BEFORE
using any encryption software, please check the country's laws,
regulations and policies concerning the import, possession, or use,
