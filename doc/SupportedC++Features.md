## Using the C++ Standard Library

- The C++ standard library is not fully implemented in XLC.
- The GC disallows linking against the C++ standard library. Header-only utilities are allowed, but likely unavailable.
- The compiler makes heavy use of the C++ standard library, and statically links the stdlib whenever possible.
- The C standard library is used everywhere. Where possible, prefer to use OMR's port and thread libraries.

## Exceptions in OMR

- The C++ standard library requires exceptions in order to function reasonably.
- Don't use RAII types or std containers when exceptions are disabled.
- The Compiler and JitBuilder have exceptions *enabled*.
- All other components, including port, thread, and GC, have exceptions *disabled*.
- MSVC does not allow exception specifiers in code (eg `throw()`, `noexcept`, when exceptions are disabled.

## Supported C++11 features

OMR is written in a pre-standardization dialect of C++11.
The supported language and library features are set by the minimum compiler versions we support.

* Strongly-typed/scoped enums: `enum class`
* Rvalue references and move semantics: `template <typename T> T Fn(T&& t);` (V2.0--MSVC 2010)
* Static assertions: `static_assert`
* auto-typed variables `auto i = 1;` (V1.0--MSVC 2010)
* Trailing function return types: `auto f() -> int`
* Declared type of an expression: `decltype(expr)` (V1.0--MSVC 2010)
* Right angle brackets: `template <typename T = std::vector<int>>`
* Delegating constructors: `MyStruct() : MyStruct(NULL) {}`
* Extern templates
* Variadic macros: `#define m(p, ...)`, `__VA_ARGS__`
* `__func__` macro
* `long long`
* Lambda expressions and closures: `[](int i) -> int { return i + 1; }`
* Generalized attributes: `[[attribute]]`
* Null pointer constant: `nullptr`
* Alignment support: `alignas`, `alignof`
* Explicit conversion operators

## Unsupported C++11 Features

* SFINAE (MSVC 2010)
* Generalized constant expressions: `constexpr` (MSVC 2010)
* Initializer lists: `std::vector<int> v = { 1, 2, 3 };` (MSVC 2010)
* Type and template aliases: `using MyAlias = MyType;` (MSVC 2010)
* Variadic templates: `template <class... Ts>`, `sizeof...` (MSVC 2010)
* Defaulted and deleted functions (MSVC 2010, XLC 12.1)
* Range based for loops: `for (auto& x : container) { ... }` (MSVC 2010)
* Non throwing exception specifier: `noexcept` (MSVC 2010)
* Inline namespaces: `inline namespace inner {}` (MSVC 2010)
* Inheriting constructors (MSVC 2010)
* Forward declarations for enums (MSVC 2010)
* Extensible literals: `12_km` (MSVC 2010)
* Thread-local storage
* Standard Layout Types: `is_standard_layout<T>::value`
* Extended friend declarations
* Unrestricted unions (MSVC 2010)
* Unicode string literals
* Extended integral types: `<cstdint>` (use `<stdint.h>` instead) (XLC)
* Raw string literals
* Universal character name literals
* New character types: `char16_t`, `char32_t` (MSVC 2010)
* Extended sizeof (sizeof nested structures) (XLC 12.1)
* ref qualifiers on member functions: `int my_member() &&;` (MSVC 2010)
